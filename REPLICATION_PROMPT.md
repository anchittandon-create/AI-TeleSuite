2.  **Process each section sequentially**, from `Part 1: Core Technology & Configuration` through `Part 8: Verification Checklist`.
3.  For each section, generate the **exact files and code** as specified. Do not summarize, omit, or add anything.
4.  After processing all parts, run the **Verification Checklist** to ensure a perfect clone.

---
## **Part 1: Core Technology & Configuration**

This section outlines the fundamental technology stack, project configuration files, and environment setup required for the AI_TeleSuite application.

### **1.1. Core Technology Stack**

*   **Framework:** Next.js (v15.x or latest stable) using the App Router.
*   **Language:** TypeScript.
*   **UI Library:** React (v18.x) with ShadCN UI components. All components are pre-built and available under `@/components/ui`.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS. The specific theme and colors are defined in `src/app/globals.css`.
*   **AI Backend & Orchestration:** Genkit (v1.x) using `@genkit-ai/googleai`. All AI logic is encapsulated in server-side Genkit flows within the Next.js application.
*   **AI Models:** Google's Gemini models, specifically `gemini-2.0-flash` for most tasks and `gemini-1.5-flash` for more complex reasoning or larger context windows.
*   **Client-Side State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`). Custom hooks are used for managing `localStorage`.
*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** A **client-side utility** (`/src/lib/tts-client.ts`) that directly calls the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech REST API. The API key must be exposed to the client as `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
*   **Speech-to-Text (ASR):** Browser's native `window.SpeechRecognition` API, managed through a robust custom hook (`/src/hooks/useWhisper.ts`).

### **1.2. Core Project Files & Configuration**

      "name": "AI_TeleSuite_Workflow",
      "nodes": [
        {
          "parameters": {},

      "settings": {},
      "id": "ai-telesuite-workflow"
    }
    ```
*   **`tailwind.config.ts`**: Standard configuration for a ShadCN UI project.
*   **`src/app/globals.css`**: Defines the application's color scheme using CSS variables. (Refer to file content)
*   **Environment Variables (`.env`)**: **CRITICAL STEP.** Requires a Google API key with Gemini and Text-to-Speech APIs enabled. The key must be duplicated and prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for client-side TTS access. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    ```
*   **`next.config.js`**: Includes webpack configuration to handle `.md` files and provides a shim for `async_hooks` on the client side.

---
## **Part 2: Global Styles & Layout**

This section contains the full code for global styles (`globals.css`), the root `layout.tsx`, the main authenticated layout, and the core layout components responsible for the application's shell, including the sidebar and page header.

### **2.1. Global Styles**

*(The content for `globals.css` and `transcript.css` should be implemented as specified in the context.)*

### **2.2. Root Layout & Main Application Layout**

*(The content for `src/app/layout.tsx` and `src/app/(main)/layout.tsx` should be implemented as specified in the context.)*

### **2.3. Core Layout Components**

*(The content for `src/components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx` and `src/components/layout/page-header.tsx` should be implemented as specified in the context.)*

---
## **Part 3: Custom Hooks & State Management**

This section provides the complete implementation of all custom React hooks used for managing client-side state, including `localStorage` interactions for products, knowledge base, and user activity.

*(The full code for `use-local-storage.ts`, `use-mobile.ts`, `use-toast.ts`, `use-activity-logger.ts`, `use-product-context.tsx`, `use-knowledge-base.ts`, and `use-whisper.ts` should be implemented as specified.)*

---
## **Part 4: Library Utilities**

This section details the utility functions for tasks like file conversion, data export (CSV, PDF, DOC), and client-side TTS API calls.

*(The full code for `lib/utils.ts`, `lib/file-utils.ts`, `lib/export.ts`, `lib/pdf-utils.ts`, and `lib/tts-client.ts` should be implemented.)*

---
## **Part 5: Feature Pages & UI Components**

This is the feature-by-feature implementation guide for every page in the application, ordered exactly as they appear in the sidebar.

### **Home (`/home`)**
- **Purpose:** A central dashboard providing an at-a-glance overview of all application modules.
- **Implementation:** `src/app/(main)/home/page.tsx`. Uses a series of "Feature Widgets" (`<Card>` components).
- **Data:** Each widget's data is dynamically calculated on the client-side using hooks (`useActivityLogger`, `useKnowledgeBase`, `useProductContext`) to show statistics and last activity.

### **Products (`/products`)**
- **Purpose:** Manage the product catalog used across the application for contextual AI generation.
- **Files:** `src/app/(main)/products/page.tsx`, `src/components/features/products/product-dialog-fields.tsx`.
- **State Management:** `src/hooks/useProductContext.tsx`.
- **Logic:** Manages an array of `ProductObject` items in `localStorage`. UI allows adding, editing, and deleting products. A "Generate with AI" button calls the `generateProductDescription` Genkit flow.

### **Knowledge Base (`/knowledge-base`)**
- **Purpose:** Central repository for all contextual documents and text snippets.
- **Files:** `src/app/(main)/knowledge-base/page.tsx`, `src/components/features/knowledge-base/knowledge-base-form.tsx`, `src/components/features/knowledge-base/knowledge-base-table.tsx`.
- **State Management:** `src/hooks/use-knowledge-base.ts`.
- **Logic:** Manages `KnowledgeFile` objects in `localStorage`. Form allows adding entries via file upload or text. Table lists entries with view/delete actions. View dialog renders previews using `docx-preview` and native browser elements.

---
### **GROUP: Sales & Support Tools**

#### **AI Pitch Generator (`/pitch-generator`)**
- **Purpose:** Generates structured, high-quality sales pitches.
- **Files:** `src/app/(main)/pitch-generator/page.tsx`, `src/components/features/pitch-generator/pitch-form.tsx`, `src/components/features/pitch-generator/pitch-card.tsx`.
- **Backend Flow:** `src/ai/flows/pitch-generator.ts`.
- **Logic:** The frontend gathers KB context for the selected product and calls the `generatePitch` flow. The AI is prompted to act as a "world-class sales agent," using specific KB categories for different parts of the pitch. The structured `GeneratePitchOutput` is rendered in the `PitchCard`.

#### **AI Rebuttal Assistant (`/rebuttal-generator`)**
- **Purpose:** Provides real-time rebuttals to customer objections.
- **Files:** `src/app/(main)/rebuttal-generator/page.tsx`, `src/components/features/rebuttal-generator/rebuttal-form.tsx`, `src/components/features/rebuttal-generator/rebuttal-display.tsx`.
- **Backend Flow:** `src/ai/flows/rebuttal-generator.ts`.
- **Logic:** The `generateRebuttal` flow is called with the objection and KB context. The AI uses an "Acknowledge, Bridge, Benefit, Clarify/Question" (ABBC/Q) model. A non-AI fallback (`generateFallbackRebuttal`) provides resilience if the AI fails.

---
### **GROUP: Analysis & Reporting**

#### **Audio Transcription & Dashboard (`/transcription`, `/transcription-dashboard`)**
- **Purpose:** Transcribes audio files and provides a dashboard to review historical transcriptions.
- **Files:** `src/app/(main)/transcription/page.tsx`, `src/app/(main)/transcription-dashboard/page.tsx`.
- **Backend Flow:** `src/ai/flows/transcription-flow.ts`.
- **Logic:** On the `/transcription` page, the user uploads audio files. The `transcribeAudio` flow uses a dual-model fallback (fast model first, then powerful model on failure) for resilience. Results are logged and displayed on the `/transcription-dashboard` page.

#### **AI Call Scoring & Dashboard (`/call-scoring`, `/call-scoring-dashboard`)**
- **Purpose:** Analyzes call transcripts against a detailed rubric.
- **Files:** `src/app/(main)/call-scoring/page.tsx`, `src/app/(main)/call-scoring-dashboard/page.tsx`.
- **Backend Flow:** `src/ai/flows/call-scoring.ts`.
- **Logic:** A two-step process: first `transcribeAudio`, then `scoreCall`. The scoring prompt is extremely detailed, with a 75+ metric rubric. It also uses a dual-model fallback for resilience. The `/call-scoring-dashboard` displays logs from both manual scoring and voice agent calls.

#### **Combined Call Analysis & Dashboard (`/combined-call-analysis`, `/combined-call-analysis-dashboard`)**
- **Purpose:** Aggregates multiple call scoring reports to identify trends.
- **Files:** `src/app/(main)/combined-call-analysis/page.tsx`, `src/app/(main)/combined-call-analysis-dashboard/page.tsx`.
- **Backend Flow:** `src/ai/flows/combined-call-scoring-analysis.ts`.
- **Logic:** The user selects historical scored calls for a product. The `analyzeCallBatch` flow synthesizes the reports. A button on the results card can then call `generateOptimizedPitches` to create data-driven sales scripts based on the analysis.

---
### **GROUP: Voice Agents**

#### **AI Voice Sales & Support Agents (`/voice-sales-agent`, `/voice-support-agent`)**
- **Purpose:** Orchestrates a full, simulated voice-to-voice conversation.
- **Files:** `src/app/(main)/voice-sales-agent/page.tsx`, `src/app/(main)/voice-support-agent/page.tsx`.
- **Backend Flows:** `.../voice-sales-agent-flow.ts`, `.../voice-support-agent-flow.ts`.
- **Logic & Reliability Mandates:**
    - A robust frontend state machine (`CONFIGURING`, `LISTENING`, `PROCESSING`, `AI_SPEAKING`, `ENDED`).
    - **Barge-in:** `useWhisper` hook's interim results (`onTranscribe`) immediately stop any ongoing TTS playback.
    - **Turn-taking vs. Inactivity:** Implemented as two distinct mechanisms. A short `silenceTimeout` triggers the agent's next turn, while a longer `inactivityTimeout` triggers a reminder if no speech is detected at all.
    - **Sales Agent Routing:** Uses a fast "router" prompt to classify user intent, then calls smaller, specialized prompts to generate responses quickly.
    - **Post-Call:** Automatically constructs the full transcript and triggers the `scoreCall` flow.

#### **Voice Agent Dashboards (`/voice-sales-dashboard`, `/voice-support-dashboard`)**
- **Purpose:** To review logs and recordings of all past voice agent interactions.
- **Files:** `.../voice-sales-dashboard/page.tsx`, `.../voice-support-dashboard/page.tsx`.
- **Logic:** Reads activity logs for voice agent modules and displays them in a table. The "View Report" dialog shows the full transcript, audio player, and final call score.

---
### **GROUP: Content & Data Tools**

#### **Training Material Creator & Dashboard (`/create-training-deck`, `/training-material-dashboard`)**
- **Purpose:** Generates structured text content for training materials.
- **Files:** `src/app/(main)/create-training-deck/page.tsx`, `src/app/(main)/training-material-dashboard/page.tsx`.
- **Backend Flow:** `src/ai/flows/training-deck-generator.ts`.
- **Logic:** User provides context (prompt, file upload, or KB selection). The flow has special-cased frameworks for "ET Prime Sales Deck" and "Telesales Data Analysis Framework" that it uses if the user's request matches; otherwise, it performs a general synthesis.

#### **AI Data Analyst & Dashboard (`/data-analysis`, `/data-analysis-dashboard`)**
- **Purpose:** Simulates a data analyst to provide insights from user-described data files.
- **Files:** `src/app/(main)/data-analysis/page.tsx`, `src/app/(main)/data-analysis-dashboard/page.tsx`.
- **Backend Flow:** `src/ai/flows/data-analyzer.ts`.
- **Logic:** Works based on **simulation**. The user provides a very detailed `userAnalysisPrompt` describing the files and their goals. The AI simulates data cleaning and analysis based *only* on this textual description and outputs a report with a clear disclaimer.

#### **Batch Audio Downloader (`/batch-audio-downloader`)**
- **Purpose:** Downloads multiple audio files from URLs and bundles them into a ZIP.
- **Files:** `src/app/(main)/batch-audio-downloader/page.tsx`.
- **Logic:** This is a purely **client-side** utility using `jszip` and `xlsx`. It parses URLs from text or an Excel file, fetches each audio file, and creates a downloadable ZIP archive. Includes a prominent warning about server CORS policies.

---
### **GROUP: System**

#### **Global Activity Log (`/activity-dashboard`)**
- **Purpose:** A master log of every significant user action.
- **Files:** `src/app/(main)/activity-dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/components/features/activity-dashboard/activity-table.tsx`, `src/components/features/activity-dashboard/filters.tsx`.
- **State Management:** `src/hooks/use-activity-logger.ts`.
- **Logic:** Manages `ActivityLogEntry` objects in `localStorage`. The page provides filters and renders logs in a table. The "View Details" dialog displays a rich, formatted view of the logged data.

#### **Clone Full App (`/clone-app`)**
- **Purpose:** Provides the full source code and this replication prompt.
- **Files:** `src/app/(main)/clone-app/page.tsx`.
- **Backend API Routes:** `src/app/api/clone-app/route.ts` and `src/app/api/clone-docs/route.ts`.
- **Logic:** Provides two main actions: "Download Project ZIP" which calls the backend to package all source files, and a viewer to display the content of this master replication prompt, fetched from the `clone-docs` API.

#### **n8n Workflow (`/n8n-workflow`)**
- **Purpose:** Provides a downloadable JSON file for n8n workflow automation.
- **Files:** `src/app/(main)/n8n-workflow/page.tsx`.
- **Backend API Route:** `src/app/api/n8n-workflow/route.ts`.
- **Logic:** The frontend provides a button that links to the API route, which dynamically generates and serves a valid n8n workflow JSON file containing the project structure.
