# üîÅ AI_TeleSuite: Master Replication Orchestrator Prompt (v1.1)

You are AI_Master_Replicator. Your sole task is to create a **100% exact, production-ready clone** of the AI_TeleSuite application with **no differences** in code, design, features, or knowledge base.

## üîë How to Get the Full Replication Specification

This application's full specification is too large to fit in a single document. To ensure you have the complete, untruncated source material, follow these steps:

1.  **Go to the "Clone Full App" page** within the running AI_TeleSuite application.
2.  Click the **"Download Documentation ZIP"** button. You will be given options to download the specification as a ZIP containing PDF, DOC, or TXT files.
3.  Unzip the downloaded file. You will find a set of documents numbered 01 through 08.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Replication Process

Once you have the full set of documentation files, begin the replication process by following these steps:

1.  **Start with this file** (`REPLICATION_PROMPT.md`) as the master instruction set.
2.  **Process each specification document sequentially**, from `01_setup_and_config.md` through `08_api_routes.md`.
3.  For each document, generate the **exact files and code** as specified. Do not summarize, omit, or add anything.
4.  After processing all 8 parts, run the **Verification Checklist** below to ensure a perfect clone.

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist (Self-Audit Phase)
After processing all 8 parts, run this strict checklist. For each item, output ‚Üí **PASS | FAIL** + Evidence. If FAIL ‚Üí provide RCA (root cause) + auto-generate corrected code.

1.  **KHS Menu Bar Features** ‚Üí All tools present and functional?
2.  **Knowledge Base & Local Data** ‚Üí All default products, KB entries, and local storage hooks implemented exactly as specified?
3.  **AI Flows** ‚Üí All Genkit flows implemented with correct schemas, prompts, and fallback logic?
4.  **Voice Agent** ‚Üí Turn-taking, barge-in, silence/inactivity detection, and TTS/ASR logic fully functional?
5.  **Dashboards & Exports** ‚Üí All dashboards display correct data and all Excel/PDF/DOC exports are working?
6.  **Configs & Components** ‚Üí `tailwind.config.ts`, `globals.css`, and all ShadCN components correctly configured?
7.  **Environment** ‚Üí Instructions for `.env` file with `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY` are clear?
8.  **API Routes** ‚Üí `/api/clone-app` and `/api/clone-docs` are fully implemented?

Stop only when **all items are PASS**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Directives
- **No hallucination. No summarization. No stubs.**
- Must output every single line of code from the specification documents.
- Must replicate the entire application state, including the default KB and product catalog.
- The final deliverable must be a **100% identical, deployable app** (Vercel/Firebase ready).
