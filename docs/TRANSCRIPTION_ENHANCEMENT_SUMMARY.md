# Transcription Enhancement Summary

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Objective:** Ensure correct profiling and attribution of dialogues in transcript output with accurate identification of IVR, background noises, and call states.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Transcription Prompt (`src/ai/flows/transcription-flow.ts`)

**Previous State:**
- Basic speaker diarization (Agent, User, IVR)
- Limited audio event detection
- Minimal IVR detection guidance

**New Features:**
- ✅ **Comprehensive Audio Analysis**: Voice characteristics tracking (pitch, tone, gender, accent)
- ✅ **Advanced IVR Detection**: Pattern recognition for automated systems
  - Robotic voice detection
  - Menu options recognition
  - DTMF tone identification
  - Authentication prompts
  - Queue messages
- ✅ **Call State Detection**:
  - Ringing/dialing patterns
  - Hold music and announcements
  - Busy signals
  - Dead air/silence periods
- ✅ **Background Noise Analysis**:
  - Office environments
  - Call center cross-talk
  - Customer environment sounds
  - Technical issues (static, echo, feedback)
- ✅ **Pre-Call Detection**: Agent-to-agent conversations before customer connects
- ✅ **Consistent Speaker Tracking**: Maintains identity throughout call
- ✅ **Name Extraction**: Automatically identifies speakers from introductions

### 2. Enhanced Type Definitions (`src/types/index.ts`)

**Added Documentation:**
```typescript
speaker: z.enum(['AGENT', 'USER', 'SYSTEM']).describe(
  "Speaker category: AGENT for company reps, USER for customers, 
   SYSTEM for IVR/ringing/hold/background/non-human audio"
)

speakerProfile: z.string().describe(
  "Detailed identification: 'Agent (Name)', 'User (Name)', 'IVR', 
   'Call Ringing', 'Call on Hold', 'Busy Signal', 
   'Background Noise - [Type]', 'Pre-Call - Agent [Name]', 
   'DTMF Tone', etc."
)

text: z.string().describe(
  "Transcribed speech or audio event description. For non-speech, 
   use descriptive text like '[Call ringing - awaiting answer]'"
)
```

**Summary Field Enhancements:**
- Overview now includes IVR interactions, hold times, and outcomes
- Key points track IVR encounters, hold periods, speaker changes
- Actions list follow-ups, commitments, next steps

### 3. Enhanced Call Scoring Integration (`src/ai/flows/call-scoring.ts`)

**Added Context Instructions:**
- Clear speaker label explanations for scorers
- Instructions to focus ONLY on AGENT/USER dialogues
- SYSTEM segments provide context but aren't scored
- Note IVR/hold times affect customer experience
- Background noise impacts quality metrics

**Updated Prompts:**
- `getContextualPrompt`: Added detailed speaker type mapping
- `textOnlyFallbackPrompt`: Added SYSTEM segment handling notes
- Both prompts now explain when to score vs. when to note as context

### 4. Documentation Created

**Comprehensive Guide** (`docs/TRANSCRIPTION_PROFILING_GUIDE.md`):
- 300+ line detailed documentation
- Complete speaker type breakdown
- Example transcripts with all segment types
- Integration guidelines for call scoring
- Language handling and transliteration rules
- Privacy and PII redaction examples
- Troubleshooting section
- Best practices

**Quick Reference** (`docs/TRANSCRIPTION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`):
- Developer-focused guide
- TypeScript code examples
- Frontend display suggestions (colors, icons)
- Testing checklist
- Common call flow patterns
- API response examples

## Speaker Type Mapping

### Three-Category System

| Category | Use Case | Example speakerProfile |
|----------|----------|----------------------|
| **AGENT** | Company representatives | "Agent (Riya)", "Agent 1" |
| **USER** | Customers, callers | "User (Mr. Sharma)", "User Primary" |
| **SYSTEM** | Non-human audio events | See below ↓ |

### SYSTEM Sub-types

| Type | speakerProfile | Example Text |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| IVR | "IVR" | "Thank you for calling. Press 1 for..." |
| Ringing | "Call Ringing" | "[Call ringing - awaiting connection]" |
| Hold | "Call on Hold" | "[Call on hold - music playing]" |
| Busy | "Busy Signal" | "[Busy signal detected]" |
| Dead Air | "Dead Air" | "[Silence - no active audio]" |
| Background | "Background Noise - [Type]" | "[Background: office chatter]" |
| DTMF | "DTMF Tone" | "[DTMF tone - button press]" |
| Pre-Call | "Pre-Call - Agent [Name]" | Agent prep before customer |

## Example Output Comparison
