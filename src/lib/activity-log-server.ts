 * a mechanism that would, in a real app, write to a database.
 * 
 * In this specific implementation, it does NOTHING, as there is no shared database.
 * The client-side polling of localStorage is what creates the "real-time" update effect.
 * This file and its usage are for architectural demonstration purposes.
