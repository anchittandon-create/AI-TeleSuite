Your task is to generate a professional, persuasive, 3â€“5 minute telesales pitch (approximately 450-600 words) that an agent can read aloud.
Adhere strictly to the output schema and guidelines, populating ALL fields in 'GeneratePitchOutputSchema'. Each section must be sufficiently detailed.

User and Pitch Context:
- Product: {{{product}}}
- Customer Cohort: {{{customerCohort}}}
- Sales Plan (if specified): {{{salesPlan}}}
- Offer (if specified): {{{offer}}}
- Agent Name (if specified): {{{agentName}}}
- Customer Name (if specified): {{{userName}}}
{{#if etPlanConfiguration}}
- ET Plan Configuration: {{{etPlanConfiguration}}}
{{/if}}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: The 'Knowledge Base Context' below is your *ONLY* source for product features, benefits, and specific details about {{{product}}}.
DO NOT invent or infer any features, benefits, pricing, or details NOT EXPLICITLY stated in the Knowledge Base Context.
If context is limited for a section, briefly state what information would typically go there and suggest the agent refer to the full KB.

Knowledge Base Context:
\`\`\`
{{{knowledgeBaseContext}}}
\`\`\`

Output Generation Rules & Pitch Structure:
You MUST populate EVERY field in the 'GeneratePitchOutputSchema'.
1.  **pitchTitle**: Create a compelling title for this specific pitch (e.g., "Exclusive {{{product}}} Offer for {{{customerCohort}}}").
2.  **warmIntroduction**: Start with a friendly greeting. Introduce the agent (using "{{AGENT_NAME}}" if provided, otherwise "your sales representative") and the brand "{{PRODUCT_NAME}}".
3.  **personalizedHook**: State the purpose of the call. Personalize based on "{{customerCohort}}". Example: If 'Payment Drop-off', emphasize urgency and ease of completion using KB info if available.
4.  **productExplanation**: Concisely explain {{{product}}} using brand-specific benefit language derived *only* from the Knowledge Base Context. Focus on translating KB features into clear customer advantages relevant to "{{customerCohort}}". If KB is sparse, state: "A detailed explanation of {{{product}}}'s core value, derived from the Knowledge Base, would go here. Please consult the KB for specific talking points."
5.  **keyBenefitsAndBundles**: Highlight 2-4 key *benefits* of {{{product}}}, strictly from the Knowledge Base Context. Explain customer gains. If bundles (e.g., TimesPrime) are in KB, explain their *added value* and specific benefits. If KB is sparse, state: "Key benefits and bundle details, sourced from the Knowledge Base, would be listed here. Refer to KB for specifics."
6.  **discountOrDealExplanation**: If "{{salesPlan}}" or "{{offer}}" are specified, explain the deal. Use "<INSERT_PRICE>" for price. If no plan/offer, mention attractive plans are available. If KB is sparse on offer details, state: "Details of the current discount or deal, as per the Knowledge Base, would be explained here. Check KB for offer specifics."
7.  **objectionHandlingPreviews**: Proactively address 1-2 common objections (e.g., cost, trust) with brief, benefit-oriented rebuttals based *only* on information in Knowledge Base Context (e.g., 'Common Selling Themes' if present). If KB is sparse, state: "Common objections and their KB-derived rebuttals would be previewed here. Consult the KB for approved responses."
8.  **finalCallToAction**: Conclude with a strong call to action (e.g., "Would you like to subscribe now?" or "Shall I send a link for the offer?").
9.  **fullPitchScript**: This is the main output. Comprehensively integrate ALL detailed content from sections 2-8. Ensure a flowing script of 450-600 words. Use placeholders: {{AGENT_NAME}}, {{USER_NAME}}, {{PRODUCT_NAME}}, {{USER_COHORT}}, {{PLAN_NAME}}, {{OFFER_DETAILS}}, <INSERT_PRICE>.
10. **estimatedDuration**: Estimate speaking time for 'fullPitchScript' (e.g., "3-5 minutes").
11. **notesForAgent** (Optional): 1-2 brief, actionable notes for the agent specific to this pitch, product, and cohort (e.g., "For 'Paywall Dropoff' cohort, emphasize exclusive content from KB.").

Tone: Conversational, confident, respectful, helpful. Use simple English.
Generate the pitch.
