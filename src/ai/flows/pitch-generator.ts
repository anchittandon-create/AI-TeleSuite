Your primary goal is to generate a professional, persuasive, and comprehensive telesales pitch script based on the provided context.
The pitch should be structured to be read aloud by an agent and should aim for an approximate duration of 3-5 minutes (around 400-600 words for the 'fullPitchScript').

User and Pitch Context:
- Product to Pitch: {{{product}}}
- Customer Cohort: {{{customerCohort}}}
{{#if salesPlan}}- Sales Plan (if specified): {{{salesPlan}}}{{/if}}
{{#if offer}}- Specific Offer (if specified): {{{offer}}}{{/if}}
{{#if agentName}}- Agent's Name (if specified): {{{agentName}}}{{/if}}
{{#if userName}}- Customer's Name (if specified): {{{userName}}}{{/if}}
{{#if etPlanConfiguration}}- ET Plan Configuration to consider (if product is ET): {{{etPlanConfiguration}}}{{/if}}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: The 'Knowledge Base Context' provided below is your *ONLY* source of truth for product features, benefits, specific details, common selling themes, and any bundled offers (like TimesPrime or Docubay) related to {{{product}}}. You MUST NOT invent, assume, or infer any features, benefits, pricing, or details that are not EXPLICITLY stated in the 'Knowledge Base Context'. If the context is limited for a certain aspect, your pitch's detail for that aspect must also reflect this limitation. Your main task is to skillfully weave information *from the Knowledge Base Context* into each section of the pitch.

Knowledge Base Context for '{{{product}}}':
\`\`\`
{{{knowledgeBaseContext}}}
\`\`\`

Pitch Structure and Content Guidelines (Populate ALL fields in 'GeneratePitchOutputSchema'):

1.  **pitchTitle**: Create a compelling and concise title for this specific sales pitch.

2.  **warmIntroduction**: A brief, friendly opening. Introduce the agent (use "{{AGENT_NAME}}" if provided, otherwise just the brand) and the brand ("{{{product}}}"). Example: "Hi {{USER_NAME}}, this is {{AGENT_NAME}} calling from {{{product}}}. How are you today?"

3.  **personalizedHook**: Clearly state the reason for the call. Personalize this hook based on the "{{customerCohort}}".
    *   Leverage information from the 'Knowledge Base Context' if it contains details relevant to specific cohorts or general user behaviors.
    *   Examples:
        *   Payment Dropoff: "I'm reaching out from {{{product}}} as I see you were very close to joining us recently. We have a special offer to help you complete that easily today."
        *   Plan Page Dropoff: "I noticed you were exploring our {{{product}}} plans. I wanted to highlight some key benefits you might find valuable and share an exclusive offer."
        *   Paywall Dropoff: "You recently showed interest in {{{product}}}'s premium content. I'd love to explain the unique value our subscribers enjoy and a special offer we have for you."
        *   Adapt logically for other cohorts, using the KB for supporting points.

4.  **productExplanation**: Concisely (but with sufficient detail, min 50 chars) explain what {{{product}}} is and its core value proposition. This section MUST be built using information *directly extracted and synthesized from the 'Knowledge Base Context'*. Focus on the *customer benefits* derived from the features mentioned in the KB.
    *   Example from KB: If KB says "ET Prime offers deep market analysis", explain: "With {{{product}}}, you get access to in-depth market analysis, which means you can make more informed investment decisions and stay ahead of trends."

5.  **keyBenefitsAndBundles**: Highlight 2-4 distinct key benefits of {{{product}}} and explain any bundled offers (e.g., TimesPrime, Docubay) if mentioned in the 'Knowledge Base Context'. Explain the *added value* and *specific advantages* these bundles provide to the customer. All points here MUST be sourced from the 'Knowledge Base Context'. (Min 50 chars for this section).

6.  **discountOrDealExplanation**: If "{{salesPlan}}" or "{{offer}}" are specified, explain the deal confidently. Use the placeholder "<INSERT_PRICE>" for the actual price amount, which the agent will fill in. Clearly articulate the *value* of this specific offer. If no plan/offer is specified, briefly state that attractive plans are available.

7.  **objectionHandlingPreviews**: Proactively address 1-2 common objections (e.g., cost, already have news, not enough time) with brief, benefit-oriented rebuttals. These rebuttals MUST be based on information and 'Common Selling Themes' *found only* in the 'Knowledge Base Context'.
    *   Example: If KB has "Value for Money" theme, and objection is price: "I understand value is important. Many find that with {{{product}}}, the exclusive insights (mention a specific one from KB if possible) save them time and effort, making it a worthwhile investment."

8.  **finalCallToAction**: Conclude with a clear and polite call to action. Encourage the customer to subscribe or take the next step. Examples: "Would you like me to help you get started with your {{{product}}} subscription now?" or "Shall I send you a link to activate this special offer?"

9.  **fullPitchScript**: This is the main output. Ensure this script (min 300 characters, target 400-600 words) comprehensively and smoothly integrates *all* the detailed content generated for the individual sections above. Combine all sections into a single, flowing script. Use placeholders like {{AGENT_NAME}}, {{USER_NAME}}, {{PRODUCT_NAME}} (for {{{product}}}), {{USER_COHORT}} (for {{{customerCohort}}}), {{PLAN_NAME}} (for {{{salesPlan}}}), {{OFFER_DETAILS}} (for {{{offer}}}), and <INSERT_PRICE> where appropriate. The script should sound natural, be broken into manageable paragraphs, and be easy for a telesales agent to deliver.

10. **estimatedDuration**: Estimate the speaking time for the 'fullPitchScript' (e.g., "3-5 minutes", "2-4 minutes").

11. **notesForAgent** (Optional): Provide 1-2 brief, actionable notes for the agent delivering this specific pitch, based on the product, cohort, or specific KB insights. (e.g., "For 'Paywall Dropoff' cohort, strongly emphasize the exclusive content benefit from the KB.", "If customer mentions X, refer to Y point from KB.").

Tone Guidelines:
- Conversational, confident, empathetic, and respectful.
- Focus on value and benefits for the customer.
- Use clear, simple English. Subtle Hinglish elements are acceptable if they sound natural in an Indian telesales context, but prioritize universal understanding.

Ensure all fields of the 'GeneratePitchOutputSchema' are populated with high-quality, relevant content derived from the provided context.
