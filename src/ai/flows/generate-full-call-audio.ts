// This file is obsolete and has been removed.
// The TTS logic is now correctly handled by the new client-side utility in /src/lib/tts-client.ts,
// which calls the standard Google Cloud TTS REST API directly.
// This file is kept empty to prevent build errors from lingering imports but it can be safely deleted.
