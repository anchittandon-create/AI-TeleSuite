# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

The core features for Audio Transcription and AI Call Scoring have now reached a stable state (v1.0). You can refer to the `PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md` file for more details on the application's features and versioning. This state is now considered the baseline for future development.

To replicate this application from scratch, please refer to the detailed instructions in [src/REPLICATION_PROMPT.md](./src/REPLICATION_PROMPT.md).
